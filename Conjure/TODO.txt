Immediate:
add quick menu for end turn/attack
add attacking
transparency of box and players behind walls
add ambient tiles such as buildings and trees
add collision to ambient tiles like trees and buildings
change render text color function

Bugs:
sometimes crashes when pushing escape too many times (hasn't happened yet)
player jumps up unfair paths from behind if another exists

Maybe:
fix drawText() to use isometric coordinates MAYBE?
pipe puzzle game
